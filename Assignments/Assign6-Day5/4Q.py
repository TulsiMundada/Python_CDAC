takes a string andsees to it that
1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed
into one, and
2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly
followed by a letter.
e.g. correct("This is very funny and cool.Indeed!")
should return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!"""
